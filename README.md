# Football leaderboard kata 
This kata is about applying TDD in the presence of *untestable* dependencies.
In the way that it's done in Kent Beck's original style of TDD, it seems to be in 
contrast with the London school but the two styles can actually be used in combination.
Your task is to write a rest-api that uses another lower level rest-api. **Do not 
mock** this external API **until you experience some difficulty** with them 
(too slow, or flaky, ...). You definately want to *explore* the other api's behaviour 
with unit tests. Then once you have a few tests, you can refactor the tests to
something more in line with the testing pyramid. 

Start with a guiding system-level test. You'r priority is to get the integration
points right, i.e. calling the external api correctly and providing the right value 
on your http endpoint. Once you have that you can probably get the interal logic
right with traditional fast unit tests.

At the end I expect you'll have three types of tests, system-tests, focused 
integration-tests and unit-tests. Personally I separate those tests in my CI
so that I can run them without polluting the unit tests with "random" failures
but still get the valuable information that an external api is down/broken. 
  
## The external api
This is code out of your control.  
It is provided as a lib and a docker container that you can start.   
 
### as a lib
    cd typescript
    npm install
    npm run start-events-api
    
or you can install it globally

    npm install -g football-events-api
    start-footballs-events-api

### using docker docker

    docker run --name footballs-events-api -p 5010:5010 footballs-events-api
    
     
You now have a webserver running you can get todays 
events on http://localhost:5010/events

This api responds with a list of all game events, like goals etc.

## Task
Write a rest-api that serve data for a score-board with 
todays' football games. 

home team | visitor team | state | score
--- | --- | --- | ---  
Barcelona | Madrid | in progress | 0 -1  
Arsenal | Paris | finished | 4 - 3      

You don't have to worry about formatting, just return 
JSON of the form

    [
      { "home": "Barcelona", 
        "visitor": "Madrid", 
        "score": [0, 1], 
        "state": "in progress" }
    ]

## Questions for the retrospective
* What did the tests on with the real dependency teach you?
* What types of tests did you end up with? System-tests, unit tests, focused integration tests? All three?
* What problems were avoided, what was encountered?
* Could this be useful in your work? Can you share your thoughts? 
* If this is the way you already work. What experiences can you share?
* What do you do with focused integration tests in the CI?


## TODOs
* publish docker
* make sure there is some coordination between external ws so that they can't be
  that easily mocked out
